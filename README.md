# SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS

# 🛒 Sales Forecast Data Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview

* This project focuses on the cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sales dataset from an online retail platform. The goal is to understand purchasing trends, product performance, and seasonal sales variations using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

# 📂 Dataset Summary

* File Name: SALES FORCAST DATSET.csv

* Total Rows: **541,909**

* Columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

# 🔧 Data Preprocessing Steps

1. Initial Data Inspection:

* Used df.info(), df.describe(), and df.isnull().sum() to understand structure and missing values.

* Identified 91 duplicated rows and dropped them.

* Handled **108,000** missing values in CustomerID and **1,025** in Description.



2. Null Value Handling:

* Filled missing object-type columns using their mode.



3. Data Cleaning:

* Removed special characters (e.g., @, #, &, $) and non-alphanumeric values from key columns.

* Removed emojis and symbols using regex from Country names.

* Dropped the InvoiceNo column as it provided no analytical value.



4. Data Type Conversion:

* Converted Quantity, StockCode, and UnitPrice to numeric.

* Transformed InvoiceDate to datetime and extracted Year, Month, Day, Time.



5. Feature Engineering:

* Created Seasons column from Month.

* Added Price of sales column (UnitPrice * Quantity).

* Renamed Description to Product and Quantity to Sales.

# 🌍 Geographic Insights

**Top Purchasing Countries**
* United Kingdom dominates sales (>91% of all sales).

**Sales Distribution by Country**
* Identified countries contributing significantly to revenue.

# 🧠 Insights & Conclusions

* United Kingdom is the major revenue generator.

* Sales spike during Winter, likely due to holiday shopping.

* Specific products are purchased repeatedly, indicating strong brand loyalty or demand patterns.

* Data cleaning is essential as the raw dataset had many formatting issues, missing values, and anomalies.
